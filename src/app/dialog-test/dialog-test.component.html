      <h4>How to use the UML editor:</h4>
      <hr>
      <h5>Creating a class</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the new button</li>
        <li>input into the fields the data you want the class to have</li>
          <ul>

          </ul>
        <li>There is a name,methods, and variables section</li>
        <li>The name method is the only required field to fill in to create a class</li>
        <li>Once complete press the submit button, and the class will be created in the page</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Editing a class</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the edit button</li>
        <li>The will be a dropdown selection that will allow you to chooose the class you want to edit from the currently
          existing classes
        </li>
        <li>Once you make your choice, then you can press the button to see the input fields (same as the new fields)
          auto-populate with data already existing.
        </li>
        <li>Make any changes you want to the data, and once complete, press the button for the class to be updated in the page</li>
        <li><strong>Note: </strong>You can also edit the class in the GUI directly</li>
        <ul>
          <li>To edit the class name, you just press the edit button in the top right corner</li>
          <li>To edit the attributes, just click on the actual attribute and you can directly edit it</li>
          <li>You can also delete attributes by pressing the X at the end of the attribute</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <!-- allow for Zach to enter his data for the delete -->
      <!-- or input here once delete functionality is complete -->
      <h5>Exporting data</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the export button</li>
        <li>A file manager should populate with a YAML file containing your current diagram</li>
        <li>Select the name you would like to use for this feed and save it to a desireable location on your machine</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Importing data</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the import button</li>
        <li>paste the data previously exported, from the export button into this popup and press the submit
          button to regenerate the data</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> upcoming functionality will include allowing the user to input the downloaded file
         taken from the export button, to generate the data</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Making connections</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Once there are classes on the page, the user can connect the classes by dragging from one of the "circles" (endpoints)
          from one to another
        </li>
        <li>You can also just drag from an endpoint to a class box and it will make a connection</li>
        <li>When a connection is made the user will be able to specify a "type" of relationship between classes</li>
        <li>After a connection is made if you click on the connection, you can pick the type of connection again in the same format as before</li>
        <li><strong>Note: </strong>Connections to itself are forcibly removed</li>

        <li>The user will then be directed to the CLI part of the application</li>
        <li>You will be greeted with a list of commands, and their functionality</li>
        <li>You can always enter help to get the list of commands again</li>
        <li>You can also press man command to get specific information about the command</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Known bugs & upcoming functionality</h5>
      <ol>
        <mat-chip-list>
          <li class="chip"><mat-chip color="warn" selected>Bug </mat-chip>Can drag classes over one another, Completion: (TBD)</li>
          <li class="chip"><mat-chip color="primary" selected>Functionality </mat-chip>Try to force connections to not overlap classes, Completion: (TBD)</li>
          <li class="chip"><mat-chip color="primary" selected>Functionality </mat-chip>UX changes, Completion: (TBD)</li>
        </mat-chip-list>
